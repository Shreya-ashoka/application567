A city needs to plan its infrastructure development by connecting multiple locations with minimum cost. The task is to find the minimum spanning tree (MST) of the city's locations using Prim's algorithm. This will help determine the optimal connections and minimize the overall cost of infrastructure development. The objective of this case study is to implement Prim's algorithm to solve the infrastructure planning problem in C language. By solving this problem, we can identify the minimum cost connections between locations and guide the city's infrastructure development.
